# banach

This R Shiny app uses Banach Fixed Point Theorem to solve a relatively complicated equation.

The app can be found at [exploration-tool.shinyapps.io/banach](https://exploration-tool.shinyapps.io/banach/).

[This presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1OiFLLU_4PGbY8kWJwM89L8Pc2jrQztf29TrbTpqgIJY/edit?usp=sharing) proves that a solution exists and explains why the algorithm works.
